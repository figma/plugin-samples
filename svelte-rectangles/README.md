# Svelte

Creates rectangles (same as the [Webpack sample plugin][webpack]).

This demonstrates:
- bundling plugin code using Rollup
- using Svelte

The main plugin code is in `src/code.ts`. The HTML for the UI is generated by parcel, while the embedded JavaScript is in `src/ui.js` and the Svelte script is in `src/App.svelte`.

These are compiled to files in `dist/`, which are what Figma will use to run

To build:
- npm install
- npm run build

For development run:
- npm install
- npm run dev
