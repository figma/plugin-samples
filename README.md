# 🍱 Figma + FigJam Plugin Samples

Sample plugins using the [Figma + FigJam Plugin API][docs].

To make a feature request, file a bug report, or ask a question about
developing plugins, check out the available [resources][help].

## Getting Started

These plugins are written using [TypeScript][ts] to take advantage of Figma's typed plugin API. Before installing these samples as development plugins, you'll need to compile the code using the TypeScript compiler. Typescript can also watch your code for changes as you're developing, making it easy to test new changes to your code in Figma.

To install TypeScript, first [install Node.js][node]. Then:

    $ npm install -g typescript

Next install the packages that the samples depend on. Currently, this will only install the lastest version of the Figma typings file. Most of the samples will reference this shared typings file in their `tsconfig.json`.

    $ npm install

Now, to compile the Bar Chart sample plugin (for example):

    $ cd barchart
    $ tsc

Now you can import the Bar Chart plugin from within the Figma desktop app (`Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest...` from the right-click menu)!

The code for each plugin is in `code.ts` in that plugin's subdirectory. If a
plugin shows some UI, the HTML will be in `ui.html`.

For example, the code for the Bar Chart sample plugin is in
[barchart/code.ts](barchart/code.ts), and the HTML for its UI is in
[barchart/ui.html](barchart/ui.html).

### Styling your plugin UI

[For plugins that have a UI](#examples-with-a-plugin-ui), we recommend matching the style and behavior of Figma. Many other plugins follow this convention and it helps create consistency in the plugin experience for users as they use different plugins. Here's a few approaches that can help when styling your UI:

- [Figma Plugin DS](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds) A lightweight UI library for styling Figma plugins.
- [Create Figma Plugin UI](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/#using-the-preact-component-library) - A library of production-grade [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) components that replicate the Figma editor’s UI design

# FigJam Plugins

The following sample plugins use the new FigJam node types ([stickies](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/StickyNode/), [shapes with text](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/ShapeWithTextNode/), [connectors](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/ConnectorNode/), and [stamps](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/StampNode/)) and so work best **in FigJam**, i.e. with an editorType of 'figjam' in your manifest.json file.

### Vote Tally

<img src="_screenshots/vote-tally.gif" width="400" />

This plugin will find all stamps close to a sticky and generate a tally of all the stamps (votes) next to a sticky on the page.

[Check out the source code.](vote-tally/)

### Create Shapes + Connectors

<img src="_screenshots/create-shapes-connectors.png" width="400" />

This plugin creates 5 `ROUNDED_RECTANGLE` Shapes with Text nodes and adds a Connector node in between each of them.

[Check out the source code.](create-shapes-connectors/)

# Additional Examples

The following sample plugins work in both Figma and FigJam.

## Conditional Plugins

You can create plugins that have conditional logic depending on whether they are run in Figma, or FigJam.

<img src="_screenshots/create-rects-shapes.png" width="400" />

When this plugin runs in Figma, it opens a window to prompt the user to enter a number, and it will then create that many rectangles on the screen.

When this plugin runs in FigJam, it opens a window to prompt the user to enter a number, and it will then create that many `ROUNDED_RECTANGLE` shapes with text nodes, and also adds a connector node in between each shape.

## Examples without a plugin UI

### Circle Text

<img src="_screenshots/circletext.png" width="400" />

Takes a single text node selected by the user and creates a copy with the
characters arranged in a circle.

[Check out the source code.](circletext/)

### Invert Image Color

<img src="_screenshots/invert-image.png" width="400" />

Takes image fills in the current selection and inverts their colors.

This demonstrates:

- how to read/write images stored in a Figma document, and
- how to use `showUI` to access browser APIs.

[Check out the source code.](invert-image/)

### Meta Cards

<img src="_screenshots/metacards.gif" width="400" />

This plugin will find links within a text node and create on canvas meta cards of an image, title, description and link based on the <meta> tags in the head of a webpage at the relative links.

[Check out the source code.](metacards/)

### Sierpinski

<img src="_screenshots/sierpinski.png" width="400" />

Generates a fractal using circles.

[Check out the source code.](sierpinski/)

### Vector Path

<img src="_screenshots/vector-path.png" width="400" />

Generates a triangle using vector paths.

[Check out the source code.](vector-path/)

## Examples with a plugin UI

### Bar Chart

<img src="_screenshots/barchart.png" width="400" />

Generates a bar chart given user input in a modal.

[Check out the source code.](barchart/)

### Document Statistics

<img src="_screenshots/stats.png" width="400" />

Computes a count of the nodes of each `NodeType` in the current document.

[Check out the source code.](stats/)

### Pie Chart

<img src="_screenshots/piechart.png" width="400" />

### Text Search

<img src="_screenshots/text-search.png" width="400" />

Searches for text in the document, given a query by the user in a modal.

This demonstrates:

- advanced message passing between the main code and the plugin UI,
- how to keep Figma responsive during long-running operations, and
- how to use the viewport API.

### Icon Drag-and-Drop

<img src="_screenshots/icon-drag-and-drop.png" width="400" />

Allows drag-and-drop of a simple icon library from a modal to the canvas.

This demonstrates registering callbacks for drop events and communicating drop data from the plugin iframe.

Note: this example uses a [proposed API](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/proposed-api/).

[Check out the source code.](icon-drag-and-drop/)

### PNG Crop

<img src="_screenshots/png-crop.png" width="400" />

Crops PNGs as they are dropped onto the canvas.

This demonstrates registering callbacks for drop events and reading bytes from dropped files.

Note: this example uses a [proposed API](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/proposed-api/).
